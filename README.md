# The Matr][x
Apple ][ matrix demo 

Initial code by the late French Touch demo group. Re-Engineered and optimized version. The code snippet here shows the realization 
of the two different effects that were contained in the original demo fragment of French Touch. I arranged these parts with the available
music file and added a timelime function which triggers the single demo parts in an endless loop featuring to theme songs from
the matrix movie.

There is also a DSK-image for the Apple ][ available for download (requires 128k and MockingBoard!).

Enjoy!
